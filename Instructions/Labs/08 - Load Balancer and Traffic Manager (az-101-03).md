1. Navigate to the blade of the public IP address resource associated with the Azure load balancer in the second region named **az1010302w-lb-pip**. 

1. From the **az1010302w-lb-pip** blade, display its **Configuration** blade. 

1. From the **az1010302w-lb-pip - Configuration** blade set the **DNS name label** of the public IP address to a unique value. 

   > **Note**: The green check mark in the **DNS name label (optional)** text box will indicate whether the name you typed in is valid and unique. 


#### Task 2: Implement Azure Traffic Manager load balancing

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Create a resource** blade.

1. From the **Create a resource** blade, search Azure Marketplace for **Traffic Manager profile**.

    - Location: either of the Azure regions you used earlier in this lab

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the newly provisioned Traffic Manager profile.

1. From the Traffic Manager profile blade, display its **Configuration** blade and review the configuration settings.

   > **Note**: The default TTL of the Traffic Manager profile DNS records is 60 seconds

1. From the Traffic Manager profile blade, display its **Endpoints** blade.

1. From the **Endpoints** blade, add the first endpoint with the following settings:

    - Type: **Azure endpoint**

    - Name: **az1010301w-lb-pip**

    - Target resource type: **Public IP address**

    - Target resource: **az1010301w-lb-pip**

    - Weight: **100**

    - Custom Header settings: leave blank

    - Add as disabled: leave blank

1. From the **Endpoints** blade, add the second endpoint with the following settings:

    - Type: **Azure endpoint**

    - Name: **az1010302w-lb-pip**

    - Target resource type: **Public IP address**

    - Target resource: **az1010302w-lb-pip**

    - Weight: **100**

    - Custom Header settings: leave blank

    - Add as disabled: leave blank

1. On the **Endpoints** blade, examine the entries in the **MONITORING STATUS** column for both endpoints. Wait until both are listed as **Online** before you proceed to the next task.


#### Task 3: Verify Azure Traffic Manager load balancing

1. From the **Endpoints** blade, switch to the **Overview** section of the Traffic Manager profile blade.

1. Note the DNS name assigned to the Traffic Manager profile (the string following the **http://** prefix). 

1. From the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane. 

   > **Note**:  If this is the first time you are launching the Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command, replacing the &lt;TM_DNS_name&lt; placeholder with the value of the DNS name assigned to the Traffic Manager profile you identified in the previous task:

   ```
   nslookup <TM_DNS_name>
   ```

1. Review the output and note the **Name** entry. This should match the DNS name of the one of the Traffic Manager profile endpoints you created in the previous task.

1. Wait for at least 60 seconds and run the same command again:

   ```
   nslookup <TM_DNS_name>
   ```
1. Review the output and note the **Name** entry. This time, the entry should match the DNS name of the other Traffic Manager profile endpoint you created in the previous task.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have implemented and verified Azure Traffic Manager load balancing

## Exercise 3: Remove lab resources

#### Task 1: Open Azure Portal
